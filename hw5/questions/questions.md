1. [15 Points] Programming Assignment: Download and run the simple python implementation of RSA from: https://gist.github.com/JonCooperWorks/5314103#file-rsa-py and answer the following questions:

a) Run the program and enter as prime numbers 17 and 19. What is the public key and the private key?
b) Give a brief explanation (less than a paragraph) of the following functions from the python code: -gcd(a, b) (line 14)
-multiplicative_inverse(e, phi) (line 22)
-is_prime(num) (line 49)
 c) Explain differences and similarities between the RSA algorithm discussed in class (pages 685-686) and the implementation found in the code: generate_keypair (line 59), encrypt(line 86), decrypt(line 94).

For #1 include some screenshots of the RSA Python implementation running and answer the questions. For #2 Answer the questions posed in the lab documents and include one screenshot of wireshark working for each lab. For #1, #2, #3, #4 submit evidence of your work through moodle in one report (i.e., as ONE pdf file). The deadline is on Sunday May 1st. No late submissions are allowed for this homework. This homework is worth 9% of the final grade.
